            <h2>Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    The beginning of my journey starts when I was a simple highschool student with computer science class on my schedule. I didn't know what I was getting into or how it would change my way of thinking. When I was younger, I always took an interest in electronics and how they work. I always knew that I would want to do something along the path of computers and coding. While this is a very broad subject. I'm willing to learn anything on the matter. I consider myself eager to leanr and ready to apply the information I absorb. As my knowledge of this subject grows, I hope I can add onto this website. Come with me on the voyage of learning, skill building, and career findings.
