                I'm Zaria Brown and we have previously` met on the home page. I'm starting to learn coding languages for I can start my career in the world of Computer Programing. Let me say, it did take me a while to take the initiative and start the learning and constant practice of coding. I wanted to make sure that it was something that I was passionate about and wouldn't mind doing even on rainy days. Once I weighed my pros and cons, I decided I would love for coding to be my career. I was able to jump right into the Coding Bootcamp of Fullstack Academy and start the process of learning and understanding. This is only the beginning for me and I do not see an end.

                    More about me is that I live in the sunshine state. I currently work as an Office Administrator at a prosthetic and orthotic company. I've been with the company for two years now. On my off days, I spend time with my family, and I spend time with my boyfriend on the weekends. I would love to start getting into the world of online video games. I, occasionally, look at anime and cartoons. I love to look at YouTube gaming videos. One of my favorite Youtubers is Markiplier. I'm new to the world of computering. I usually stick to my phone and my iPad.
